# 📋 blog‑check

> A macOS/zsh script for auditing Blogger custom‑domain DNS settings, Google Search Console verification, propagation status, and root‑to‑www forwarding.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Self‑Test Environment** (dig, ping, curl)
- 🔍 **DNS Audit & Propagation**  
  - Verify CNAMEs for `www`, optional subdomain, and Google Search Console  
  - Compare resolution across public (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, 9.9.9.9) vs authoritative nameservers  
- 🔄 **Root‑Domain Forwarding Validation**  
- 🔒 **Blogger HTTPS Status** (Availability + HTTP→HTTPS redirect)  
- ⚠️ **Nameserver Sanity Check** (detects “glue‑style” NS misconfiguration)  
- 🛠 **Advanced Diagnostics** (`--advanced` flag): traceroute + subdomain enumeration  
- 🐞 **Debug Mode** (`--debug` flag): raw `dig +trace` + full HTTP headers  

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **OS:** macOS (zsh)  
- **Required CLI Tools:** `dig`, `curl`, `ping`  
- **Optional (for advanced):** `traceroute`, `subfinder`
